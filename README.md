# Multiplayer Bomberman Game

## Overview
This project is a competitive multiplayer Bomberman game, developed as part of the Software Technology course at the ELTE Faculty of Informatics. Inspired by classic Bomberman games like Dyna Blaster, this game features 2D gameplay with destructible and indestructible obstacles, power-ups, and various game modes. The game is designed for 2 players, with the goal of being the last player standing.
